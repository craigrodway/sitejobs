Site Jobs web application
=======================

Site Jobs is a bespoke web application for a school site maintenance team - like an ICT Helpdesk but for caretakers and the problems they are responsible for.

It uses a custom authentication method which utilises IIS Integrated Windows Authentication hosted on another server.
